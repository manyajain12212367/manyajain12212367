<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Manya</h1>
A Curious mind who recently found her interest in Cyber Security (Especially in Malware and Memory Analysis with Cryptography)
I love understanding how threats operate under the hood — from process injection to kernel-level artifacts — and investigating incidents like a digital detective.

I enjoy:
- 🧠 Memory analysis using **Volatility 2 & 3**
- 🐛 Malware static & dynamic analysis  
- 🔎 OSINT investigations  
- 📁 Extracting IOCs, analyzing artifacts, building case studies  
- 🧪 Breaking things, analyzing them, and documenting the story behind the incident

🛠️ Tech & Tools I have tried and is still discovering more about

**Forensics & IR:**  
`Volatility` • `Autopsy` • `FTK Imager` • `Plaso` • `Regshot`  

**Malware Analysis:**  
`Ghidra` • `IDA Free` • `PE-bear` • `ProcMon` • `Strings` • `YARA`  

**Sandbox & Threat Intel:**  
`Any.Run` • `Hybrid Analysis` • `VirusTotal`  

**Cybersecurity Fundamentals:**  
`Linux` • `Networking` • `OSINT` • `Cryptography`

## 🧩 Featured Projects  
### 🔍 OSINT Investigation Tasks (Practical Casework) — Nov 2025
**Focused on attribution, digital footprint mapping, and data correlation from open sources.**  
- Investigated usernames, emails, and phone numbers to trace digital footprints, breached credentials, and online activity patterns.  
- Used **Google Dorking, metadata extraction, SOCMINT**, and public recon tools to ethically collect, correlate, and validate intelligence.  
- Produced structured, evidence-backed OSINT reports containing leads, confidence levels, data source mappings, and timelines.


### 🧠 In-Memory Malware Detection & Analysis (Volatility2) — Oct 2025
**Advanced RAM forensics to uncover stealthy malware behavior and injection techniques.**  
- Used **Volatility2** (pslist, psscan, pstree, malfind, ldrmodules) to detect a **missing PPID**, suggesting PID tampering, and identified a masquerading process (**IXPLORE**) with signs of **DLL Injection**.  
- Analyzed injected code regions, suspicious VADs, and memory-resident artifacts; validated findings via **VirusTotal** (low detection).  
- Delivered a **7-page forensic report** with IOCs, infection chain reconstruction, hash indicators, and actionable recommendations for SOC/IR teams.

### 🔐 EnDecoder — Custom Encryption Tool (AES, RSA, Caesar, Flask) — Jul 2024  
**Full-stack cryptography project implementing multiple classical & modern encryption schemes.**  
- Led development of the **AES** and **RSA** encryption modules, ensuring secure implementation and seamless backend integration.  
- Contributed across the project stack: API development, algorithm workflows, testing, and team coordination.  
- GitHub Repository: 👉 [EnDecoder](https://github.com/manyajain12212367/EnDecoder.git)

## **📓 Cybersecurity Journal (Ongoing)**

I learned that journaling helps learning stick — so I decided to journal my cybersecurity journey.

After exploring multiple domains during my B.Tech CSE, cybersecurity finally clicked when it was presented from a different perspective. By March 2025, I chose this field, and by September 2025, I found my core interest in defensive security, especially malware and memory analysis.

Now, I’m restarting from the basics (ISC2 CC), revisiting tools, and rebuilding my knowledge cleanly and intentionally — strengthening fundamentals and replacing scattered understanding with a solid foundation.

### 🧠 Fun Fact  
I don’t just analyze malware — I *enjoy* chasing down weird processes, suspicious memory artifacts, and unpacking binaries like digital puzzles.
